- [ ] can we create aliases that are a persons nick. that would be neat
- [ ] enforce that aliases are essentially a path
- [ ] add output of print($) to the docs and enforce it on ci
- [ ] .add should become alias prop?
- [ ] expose Intl
- [ ] fix autoreloading
- [ ] .remind
- [ ] change dev prefix to $
- [ ] print($) should show docs/descriptions somehow
