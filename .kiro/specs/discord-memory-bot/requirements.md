# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Discord bot with memory functionality that allows users to store and retrieve text snippets using aliases. The bot supports two main commands: `remember` for storing content and `where` for retrieving it. The system maintains separate namespaces for different Discord servers and individual users in DMs, ensuring data isolation and preventing conflicts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want to store text content with a memorable alias so that I can easily retrieve it later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types `.remember <alias> <text>` THEN the bot SHALL store the text with the given alias
2. WHEN storing content THEN the bot SHALL validate that the alias is between 1-100 characters
3. WHEN storing content THEN the bot SHALL validate that the text is between 1-1000 characters
4. WHEN storing content THEN the bot SHALL accept aliases containing alphanumeric characters, underscores, dashes, dots, and slashes
5. WHEN storing content THEN the bot SHALL treat aliases as case-insensitive
6. WHEN text is empty THEN the bot SHALL reject the remember command with an error message
7. WHEN text exceeds 1000 characters THEN the bot SHALL reject the remember command with an error message
8. WHEN alias exceeds 100 characters THEN the bot SHALL reject the remember command with an error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want to retrieve stored content using its alias so that I can access previously saved information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types `.where <alias>` THEN the bot SHALL return the stored text for that alias
2. WHEN retrieving content THEN the bot SHALL escape all Discord mentions in the output text
3. WHEN an alias is not found THEN the bot SHALL respond with "Alias not found" and explain how to create an alias
4. WHEN matching aliases THEN the bot SHALL perform case-insensitive matching

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Discord server administrator, I want each server to have its own isolated memory space so that aliases don't conflict between different servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user stores content in Server A THEN the alias SHALL only be accessible within Server A
2. WHEN a user stores content in Server B with the same alias as Server A THEN the bot SHALL treat them as separate entries
3. WHEN retrieving content THEN the bot SHALL only search within the current server's namespace

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want to use the bot in direct messages with personal aliases so that I can have private memory storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a remember command in DM THEN the bot SHALL store the alias in the user's personal namespace
2. WHEN a user sends a where command in DM THEN the bot SHALL only search the user's personal namespace
3. WHEN storing in DM THEN the bot SHALL isolate each user's aliases from other users' aliases

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want clear feedback when operations succeed or fail so that I understand the bot's behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a remember command succeeds THEN the bot SHALL confirm the alias was stored
2. WHEN a remember command fails validation THEN the bot SHALL explain the specific validation error
3. WHEN a where command finds an alias THEN the bot SHALL return the stored text with escaped mentions
4. WHEN a where command fails THEN the bot SHALL provide helpful instructions on creating aliases

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the bot to handle data persistence so that stored aliases survive bot restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot restarts THEN all previously stored aliases SHALL remain accessible
2. WHEN storing data THEN the bot SHALL persist it to permanent storage
3. WHEN retrieving data THEN the bot SHALL load it from permanent storage
