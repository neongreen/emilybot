# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create command query service for database access
  - Implement Python service to query available commands for a user/server context
  - Add method to get all commands as a dictionary mapping names to content
  - Handle command name normalization and scoping logic
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Extend execution context types with enhanced information
  - Add messageContent, timestamp, and userName fields to existing context interfaces
  - Update context creation functions to populate new fields
  - Ensure backward compatibility with existing context usage
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.6_

- [x] 3. Implement global context provider for $ object creation
  - Create TypeScript module using QuickJS Emscripten APIs (vm.newObject, vm.setProp)
  - Implement command property access using QuickJS object handles
  - Implement function call access using vm.newFunction for $('command-name')
  - Add ctx property with execution context using nested QuickJS objects
  - Implement proper handle disposal using Scope.withScope() or .consume() patterns
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6_

- [x] 4. Add utility library to global context
  - Implement $.lib object using vm.newObject() and QuickJS function handles
  - Add $.lib.random(min, max) and $.lib.print() using vm.newFunction()
  - Ensure utilities are discoverable through console.log($.lib)
  - Properly dispose of all utility function handles
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 5. Make global object immutable and secure
  - Use QuickJS property descriptors to make $ object properties read-only
  - Leverage QuickJS context isolation for security between executions
  - Ensure commands cannot modify the global execution environment
  - Test that each execution gets a fresh, isolated QuickJS context
  - _Requirements: Security and isolation from design_

- [x] 6. Integrate global context into JavaScript executor
  - Modify executor.ts to inject $ object using QuickJS APIs before code execution
  - Use Scope.withScope() for proper memory management during injection
  - Pass available commands from Python layer to TypeScript executor
  - Handle command resolution and execution within QuickJS context
  - Ensure all handles are properly disposed after execution
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [ ] 7. Update Python JavaScript executor to provide command data
  - Modify javascript_executor.py to query and pass available commands
  - Update context creation to include enhanced fields (messageContent, timestamp, userName)
  - Ensure proper JSON serialization of enhanced context data
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6_

- [ ] 8. Implement error handling for command access
  - Add proper error messages for non-existent commands
  - Ensure errors are user-friendly for Discord context
  - Handle edge cases like empty command names or invalid characters
  - _Requirements: 1.5_

- [ ] 9. Ensure discoverability through console.log output
  - Format $ object to display clearly when logged to console
  - Ensure all properties (commands, ctx, lib) are visible in output
  - Test that output fits well in Discord message format
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 10. Write tests for global object immutability
  - Test that $ object cannot be overwritten or modified
  - Test that commands cannot interfere with each other's execution environment
  - Test that $.ctx and $.lib properties are protected from modification
  - _Requirements: Security and isolation from design_

- [ ] 11. Write tests for command access patterns
  - Test property access ($.commandName) for valid JavaScript identifiers
  - Test bracket access ($['command-name']) for names with special characters
  - Test function call access ($('command-name')) for any command name
  - Test error handling for non-existent commands
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [ ] 12. Write tests for context access and utility functions
  - Test $.ctx properties return correct execution context information
  - Test $.ctx.user object contains id and name
  - Test $.lib utility functions work correctly
  - Test that all objects are discoverable through console.log
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 13. Create comprehensive user documentation
  - Document all $ object properties and methods
  - Provide examples of command access patterns
  - Document $.ctx properties and their meanings
  - Document $.lib utility functions with usage examples
  - _Requirements: All requirements - complete user-facing behavior documentation_


- [ ] 15. Optimize QuickJS integration performance
  - Profile handle creation and disposal overhead
  - Optimize object structure creation for the $ global
  - Consider handle reuse patterns where appropriate
  - Test execution performance with large command sets
  - _Requirements: Performance considerations from design_
